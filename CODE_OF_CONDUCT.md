Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
- All repository spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
- Community forums and chat channels
- Project-related events and meetups
- Social media interactions related to the project
- Any other spaces where community members interact in the context of AutoReplyPro
